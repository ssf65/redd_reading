The overall arc makes sense but not in the way it was executed.\n\nFor example, Dany as the Mad Queen does make sense but not the way it was written here. Dany has always struggled with balancing a desire for mercy and justice with a desire for power. Had she been forced into a decision where she had to weigh the lives of everyone in King's Landing with her desire for power and revenge then yes, her madness and murder could have made sense for her character. But as it is she had already won the battle and chooses to kill innocent civilians because haha she's crazy now didn't you see that coming she's unhinged! It doesn't track. Why would Dany, Breaker of Chains, murder her future subjects when there was no reason to do so? A queen who ignores the needs of her citizens in pursuit of ultimate power, at expense of all else, THAT is a mad queen I could have believed. But power was already achieved and Cersei doesn't care about her subjects...Killing innocents for shits and giggles isn't who Dany is even if she were going mad.\n\nSame with Jaime. His return to Cersei could have made sense if only we had gotten actual insight into his struggle, if we had been given more time and depth to explore his character. Instead he returns to Cersei in a snap of a finger because he all of a sudden realizes she may die? And he didn't realize this before?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis episode could have been emotionally gutting and staggering if only any of the motivations or character arcs had actually cohered. Instead things are shoved down our throats and forced to fit together all in the name of shock and spectacle (which, by the way, could have been preserved without sacrificing writing quality).\n\nWhat an utter and absolutely crushing disappointment to see Game of Thrones mangled and spat on like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: removed word \"most\"",

It was an \u201cinteresting\u201d road to this episode but given where we are now, I thought they did pretty good with this episode. We got good endings to story arcs with Tyrion/Varys, Arya/Hound, Cleganebowl, Tyrion/Jamie, even the Jamie/Cersei ending I didn\u2019t hate.\n\nSomething I\u2019ve had to come to grips with, is that the show is NOT ASOIAF...it\u2019s truly just \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d. They didn\u2019t have time to dive into the depth of the ASOIAF universe - they had to focus on GoT. The thing about the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is that no matter how well you play the game, you always get caught up in it - the lust for power, blood, or ego just take over and you get sucked in. Targaryen, Baratheon, Lannister, Tyrell, and now Targaryen again, everybody comes along with the best intentions (or not) and the end result is the same - death, destruction, betrayal, etc.  History just repeats itself.\n\nFor 8 seasons now we\u2019ve held some hope for Dany that she was different and would change all that...Khaleesi, mother of dragons, breaker of chains, Mhysa, Azor Ahai even! But ever since she left Mereen and turned her focus to the iron throne...that set her down this path that led her tonight and she basically turned into her father - Mad King 2.0. You play the game, you WILL lose.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019ll be Jon/Aegon in the end - he refuses to play the game. I predict he will kill Dany BUT not want the throne. Just as Aegon the conqueror united the seven kingdoms, it\u2019ll be Aegon the 6th to dissolve the throne for good and go back to the way it was, effectively \u201cgame (of thrones) over\u201d...",

Can you imagine what this dark change would have looked like if they did it over the course of two full seasons? She went from breaker of chains to the burner of children in two and a half hours.

The scenes with Dany + Tyrion, Dany + Jon, Jaime + Tyrion, those moment with Jon + Davos in the battle, and Jaime + Cersei's last scene together were great.\n\n\"Guess it will be fear then\" was actually a good scene for the \"Mad Queen\" to emerge. \n\nThe Sack of King's Landing was all too real. How many times throughout history do the \"good guys\" become the bad guys after winning? \n\nBut the downside is that it just continues the same downward trend the show has been on:\n\nCharacters being idiots (Varys openly committing treason in broad daylight to Jon on the beach? Writing a letter in his office?)\n\nIncessant cutaways any time a scene threatens to tackle something heavy or emotional\n\nInconsistent logic: last week Euron couldn't miss, this time they couldn't hit the broadside of a barn? Just happens to show up on the beach? Cersei just kindly letting Jon and Co. camp outside the walls? And considering Jaime took two stabs through the rib cage, knife wounds continue to mean little to the main characters.\n\n\"Mad Queen Dany\" totally shoehorned in. I do think the books will lead up to Dany going mad but the show handled it terribly. She's upset that everyone likes Jon so she decides the best course of action is to burn the city down and rule through fear? We all knew it was leading up to \"no one in Westeros loves me\" but it needed more than a minute of screen time to go from that to slaughtering tens of thousands of people.",

Absolutely wrecked the opposition with minimal resistance.\n\nGlad Euron died, haven't met him in the books yet, but show Euron is such a fucking awful character, one of the worst I have ever seen. A vulgar, witless oaf with such ham-fisted dialogue, I scarcely imagine Sir Laurence Olivier could render an even vaguely tolerable portrayal.\n\nI like the idea of Dany being the mad Queen but it's not been alluded to enough, and suddenly escalated seemingly overnight. Yeah, she executed the Tarlys for defying her, many sane people have done worse. All of a sudden she's going crazy with bags under her eyes.\n\nJaime's arc has been shat on, he's clearly had reservations about Cersei before but he's gone straight back to her in time for the lamest death ever in the dungeons. Two great characters snuffed out in unfulfilling fashion. I just can't buy him being that much of a little bitch that a woman as horrible as Cersei can have such a hold on him.\n\nQyburn's death made me laugh out loud, what the fuck was that?",

Tyrion has always seemed to have bad luck at being hand of the queen so she is very suspicious that he is subverting her. When she found out she is not the last Targaryn she was pissed, then Jon betrays her by telling his family after she specifically tells him not to. She knows everyone would willingly accept him as king. I think she is going mad queen because everything around her is going to shit. \n\nThat being said for Tyrion to free Jamie eh I guess I can buy that as it is his brother but for him to yet again think Cersei will change that seems doubtful. Was Cersei, who's whole life is about power, just going to go hide out & live as a peasant somewhere? What was the plan with that. \n\nWhere I feel most disappointed is that the Three Eyed Raven plot & Faceless Man plot seem to be nothing. Those were my two least favorite plots, I had to watch a season of \"a girl has no name\" etc & Bran to travel to the Weirwood to turn in to the Three Eyed Raven. So if that could have turned out to be anything but a waste of time that would be nice.  Being the Three Eyed Raven or the Faceless man seems to mean nothing.\n\n Especially Bran his character never did much in the show, then they made him the Three Eyed Raven a power of which he hasn't really used for anything.  Sure he found out how the Night King was made but that wasn't of any use in the battle. He found out Jon was a Targaryn but so did Sam. Arya kind of forgot about her list & forgot about being the faceless man. Yes she just used what she learned at The House of Black & white to her advantage to kill people on her list but now it seems like that even plot is just forgotten? She's just eh I learned to be faceless to kill everyone on my list but I'm over that now? \n\nI wished she would have stayed with The Hound as their relationship is one of my favorites.",

She sees him and says something along the lines of \u201cYou took too long\u201d (obviously not those lines, but just remembered back to s4). She shows 0 empathy and this breaks Jamie to the point where he kills her. She gets humanized at the end of the episode and you almost feel bad for her, but the show up to this point has made her out to seem like a monster, even if Tyrion says she\u2019s not, this would\u2019ve been, in my opinion, a nice conclusion to both Jamie and Cersei\u2019s stories.\n\nSide note: When Euron dies he says \u201cI\u2019m the man who killed Jamie Lannister\u201d when he\u2019s probably the first person in a hundred years to snipe a dragon out of the sky.

If there was an award for improvement Emilia fucking deserves it.\n\n-The Tyrion and Captured Jaime scene is so good, even disregarding the whole \"he didn't take his hand off\" factor. Jaime's supposed to be the least clever Lannister, so what happens in this scene makes sense, but considering all the lazy writing lately, him raising his hand in response to Tyrion is almost a comic relief moment.\n\n-\"You were the only one who never treated me like a monster\" Goddamn. This feels like a cliche but it got me. I about fucking cried. That little noise Dinklage makes when he's hugging Jaime.\n\n-Sapochnik is great. I'd love to see him do blockbusters. Dude has worked with disappointing scripts but his episodes feel like works of art regardless. Battle of the Bastards is still one of my favorite episodes.\n\n-Oh, NOW the fucking Euron vs. Dragons bit feels accurate.\n\n-Jon's \"Find somewhere to hide.\" He's a natural leader. This is a wild scene to include and will be great context for Jon's actions moving forward. Jon vs. Dany is coming, if this episode is any indication.\n\n-Not cool with the \"bells break Dany\" idea. Her children have died in front of her, Jorah and Missandei have also died in front of her, so her descent into madness kinda makes sense, but that doesn't make it a satisfying narrative decision. I really hope the next episode salvages it in some way.\n\n-Jaime vs. Euron plot is DUMB.\n\n-What a fantastic cast. I know the knee-jerk reaction to this mediocre writing is \"I want a remake!\" but honestly they got so much right here. The writing is literally the only problem.\n\n-Alternating between Arya and Sandor was good cinematography. CLEGANEBOWL!!!\n\n-At least Arya's arc had a good ending. \"Don't focus on vengeance\" isn't super original and it's kinda rushed here but it's good to see at least one of the main characters gets a solid character arc.\n\n-I dislike Jaime's ending. It's not *bad* but it kinda feels like a step back. I figured his arc would be about learning to become his own person away from Cersei. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe his relationship with Brienne meant nothing. He and Cersei just got killed by a cave-in. Hopefully the fact that their escape failed means Tyrion is okay? Unless Dany notices *where* the corpses are found. Idk if I have that much confidence in the writing anymore.",

The main difference between this and the books will be 1. Less plot holes. 2. fAegon being on the Iron Throne when this happens. 3. A more natural progression from Dany the liberator to Dany the Conqueror. Honestly guys... The Targaryen house words are \u201cFire and Blood\u201d. Targaryens are Dragons, and Dragons have never been good. Dragons are destruction incarnate, flying dinosaur demons. \n\nAs far as the Episode goes? Great acting, and good direction. This is what war is. It\u2019s not fun, glorious, or honorable. It\u2019s rape and murder. Its executions. Its children dying. It\u2019s unrelenting destruction. Did you think that medieval sackings were pretty? Have you heard of the  sacking of Jerusalem, or the sacking of Constantinople? Have you seen pictures of the aftermath of the Bombing of Britain? The Bombing of Dresden? What about the death and destruction wrought during the attack on Pearl Harbor, or the Bombing of Nagasaki or Hiroshima? How about 9/11? I think we\u2019ve all seen the videos and the pictures of that, the majority of us lived through it. One of the greatest heroes of Western Civilization is Julius Caesar. Even after what he did to Alesia. War is not pretty. Sometimes it is necessary, many times it\u2019s not. It\u2019s chaos, and things get out of hand. Things are bound to get out of hand when you give an extremely powerful weapon to a jealous, angry, ambitious, and vengeful absolute monarch. \n\nWe\u2019ve all been clamoring for Fire and Blood, this is what Fire and Blood is. Hopefully GRRM finishes the book and makes the progression make more sense, but ultimately ASOIAF is a story about ambition, power, war and what that does to the human heart.",

She's the favorite character. We don't need to be reminded any more. \n\nJon being so morally rigid would make you think that he would not idly let Dany plan on burning the entire city.

Probably need to be saved for next episode. \n\nHaving so many characters be killed this episode made all of them feeling meaningless. Similar to how a character finishes their arc so you know it's time for them to die or characters start planning the future and die. It just felt way too t\"ied up in a bow\" for what has made this show/story be what we've all enjoyed. \n\nWe're going to need a new subreddit to function as a support group for all of us that need closure after this wack season.\n\nEdit: I'm trying to forget about Jaime which is why I didn't mention him.

There has been no time to flesh out and develop any of what happened. I am fine with Dany\u2019s direction but I think this season and the last could have used more episodes and more careful writing more consistent with earlier seasons.... possibly even another season. My biggest complaint  about this episode is I\u2019m disappointed Cersei and Jaime\u2019s conclusion didn\u2019t amount to something more important....more Cersei than Jaime. I\u2019m mostly ok with Jaime\u2019s direction.....again I just think this could have been fleshed out more similarly to the rest of just about everything. I think Dany\u2019s direction is from GRRM. If people overall hate the way Dany\u2019s story goes however he has a rare opportunity as an author to alter his story and give his readers an alternative ending. But to be honest I\u2019m not sure a happily ever after ending would quite fit either. So I bet he sticks with it for the books. It will be quite different in many ways with some of the other characters and factions that got cut from the show, but I\u2019d expect Dany to go mad.",

            "text": "Oh my! This episode is going to start some battles here on reddit (hopefully they will be better than the visually amazing spectacle we saw on television just now)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR; There were some good things, but what was lacking outweighed the good purely in my opinion. I won't attack anyone else's opinion here, please don't attack mine.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to try and be neutral about this:\n\n**What I loved:**\n\n\\-There were some scenes that were absolutely amazing drama and story wise - The farewell hug between Jamie and Tyrion, The interaction between Tyrion and Varys right before he was executed, the entire sequence of the camera following Arya's POV.\n\n\\-It was a visual spectacle, it was amazing to see all the action, the effects were good and the chaos of the battle was well directed. Again Arya's POV scenes were shining examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unfortunately, there were parts that I cannot live with:**\n\n\\-The change in balance of power between ballistae and dragon from last week. I don't care which one is more powerful, but you cannot switch the whole balance of power so much between two episodes where they were able to kill 1 out of 2 dragons without any casualties in the last episode and they were completely annihilated in this one. Maybe if they showed the previous episode was a fairer fight between the two weapons, like if they had shown a decent number of casualties in the last episode while killing the first dragon it would have made more sense that with a little bit of tweaking Dany was able to get the rest. The way it was done however, left me wanting for more.\n\n\\-Dany's character, Again, the biggest problem here is pacing. You cannot show someone as protector of innocents for 7 seasons and then change her character so much in the span of 1-2 episodes where she basically starts murdering unarmed civilians, women and children included. I guess the story demanded Dany be the bad guy, but the show runners pushed themselves into a corner by waiting so late to turn her character arc.\n\n\\-Cleganebowl, I know this comment will be controversial, I felt the showrunners included this solely for fan-service. There was no point and quite honestly it wasn't even that good.\n\n\\-The meaningless fight between Euron and Jamie, If they were planning to give Jamie and Cersei the rushed and senseless death they got in the end(more on that later) there was no point to show the fight between Euron and Jamie. What purpose did it serve? Till the scene started I was happy assuming Euron died in battle with Drogon.\n\n\\-The way Jamie and Cersei were killed, I would have been happy to see something different, like them escaping in a boat followed by an epilogue where they show Jamie raising a kid alone somewhere far away as a farmer while Cersei died of childbirth. That would have felt a satisfying end to Jamie's character, their deaths in this episode just felt rushed and senseless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I guess the showrunners biggest problem has been pacing**. It took a while to kill off other major characters, Eddard's beheading was built up over a few episodes of political struggle, Tywin's death happened suddenly but there was an arc where we saw him become a character worthy to be shot dead by his own son, Ramsay Bolton's death came after almost half a season of struggle. Yet here we are with the Night King, Cersei, and presumably Dany next episode all killed off in the span of 4 episodes. The worst of these will be Dany's arc which has simply turned too fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the counter argument: We have to understand the constraints of time the showrunners are working with, which is why everything feels so rushed. Well, honestly, you can't do that in the last two seasons. You can't build up an epic and just finish it off all of a sudden, I can understand their constraints but I can at the same time not like a rushed story. I wouldn't like it if LoTR - Two towers ended with a cut to Mount Doom where Frodo appeared out of nowhere and dropped the ring thus prematurely ending the story",

Nope!

Nope! They all last about 10 seconds total and aren't even slightly a problem!\n* Everyones agreed that if the bells ring, the City has surrendered...and the bells ring so that's it? Nope! Jon *and* Davos decide that rather than command their soldiers (You know, their whole purpose for in charge) they'll first just stare at the Lannister soldiers both before and while the bells ring rather than outright saying to stop, but then Dany decides she doesn't care and destroys the city because she's evil now, so Grey Worm just doesn't care anymore either, and then Jon and Davos \"kinda forgot about\" being in charge and *just watch* while their forces decide they want to ignore that the city surrendered! \n* Whole arc with Jaime was such a massive letdown that threw away his entire character development at the last minute\n\nCharacter development? Story arcs? Satisfying conclusions to plot points? Fan theories? Propecies that are part of the show's lore? Nope, forget all that!

They made Arya an invincible ninja who doesn't afraid of anything, but at the same time forgot to include her humanity. I love Arya in the books due to her saddness; her family is dying, her siblings are lost and she has nowhere to go but to a cult who worships a god of literal death. She can't escape death no matter how hard she tries. She doesn't need to be an 'awesome unbeatable warrior hero!!!' in order to be a good female character.\nDany on the other hand, used to be a complex character (at least before season 6 lmao). She was a weak, but caring, young girl, who learned to comand respect and inspire loyalty in one of the most bloodthirsty societies in the world of ASOIAF. While she excels at conquering, she has a kind heart and identifies with the downtrodden. She holds off on sailing to Westeros in order to free slaves and bring bloody justice to those who take advantage of the weak. Dany has both kind and brutal sides to her. For her to go from Mhysa to The Burner of Children in 2 episodes is unsatisfying. While I could see Dany becoming a tragic figure, I doubt her book story will end with her burning KL for funsies. I could see her burning the red keep out of anger and desperation and unknowingly setting off the wildfire in the kingdom - tragically fulfilling her father's desire to 'burn them all'.\nBut nah, female GOT characters are either invincible, infallible heroes or crazy, over-emotional messes who love barbequing babies",

Anytime you have a series that is this epic and full of such lore, intrigue, and complexity, I'm sure it's next to impossible to finish it in a satisfactory way.  We're asking the writers of this show to do something that even GRR Martin can't do:  come to a conclusion.\n\nHowever, that being said, I don't like how they handled Dany's decline.  She has always had a dark side, but in the past it was more subtle and meaningful.  She was at times merciless against her foes, but these were people who had wronged her or harmed people she sought to protect.  \n\nIt would have made sense, if she and Drogon had laid waste to the city while in the process of trying to conquer it.  i.e. Collateral damage. It would have made sense if she slaughtered the surrendering lannister army out of rage and retribution.  It would have made sense if she killed tons of people while levelling the Red Keep to get at Cersei.  All of these could have furthered the idea that she was becoming increasingly unstable and unhinged, but not reduce her to a one dimensional evil villain. \n\nIt made no sense for her to scoure the streets of King's Landing, intentionally slaughtering woman and children.  I suppose the writers want to make us hate her, but this doesn't seem to jibe with the past writing where most characters were not portrayed so black and white",

She was betrayed, she was deprived of almost everyone who supported her, Missandei died, two of her children died, Jon doesn't want her anymore. She has lived her entire life dreaming of sitting on the Iron Throne. Since she gave birth to the dragons, she's been on a quest to conquer king's landing. Everything she lost, she lost because of her hunger of power, because she couldn't just be content with being the queen of meereen. But she sees it differently: she is a paranoid, just like her father was, and the lack of people's love toward her just served as confirmation for her paranoia, so she thinks it's not her fault, but the objective of her hunger's: the city, the throne. She is actually mad with the city. And even though this doesn't make sense, it does in the eyes of a paranoid person. So even though I don't think the episode was perfect, I really liked that part, and I saw it coming since she killed all the masters in meereen.",

But her mounting Drogo and all of the sudden having him wrapped around her finger in just two chapters despite being a weak timid girl a couple chapters ago is fine? \n\nNot even trying to criticize the books, but it just seems like people complaining that there have been no hints of her reversal in character haven\u2019t been paying attention to Dany for the past 3 seasons.\n\nI think the complaint about Dany should be more about how badly her \u201cmadness\u201d was executed rather than \u201cit wasn\u2019t built up enough\u201d. Up to this episode, her character descent was perfectly built up to be a ruthless and cold dictator, it just took a left turn when they decided to burn the whole city **after** she won...",

I have never seen a more gross misunderstanding of characters, pointless bullshit, and flismy to the point of not even existing logic in a story in my life. I have been able to deal with everything the show has thrown me so far. I could deal with all the dumb shit and yuck it up afterwards. I could meme on it, and still watch the show because it was bad, but not that bad. This was that bad. If this wasn't the penultimate episode, I would drop the show. The only positive I could give is that I actually like Arya in this episode and her last scene with Sandor was great. But everything else, awful awful awful. I'm actually sad over how bad this was. Not even #CleganeBowlGetHype could make me happier because I fucking hate how it happened, and it was surrounded by fucking shit. I could go on, about how they finally put Jamie down like a fucking run over dog, how nothing made sense or amounted to anything, how Danyerus's character was torn and burned, how they somehow made Cersei seem like a good person, but I would just be repeating myself: it's shit, please god end it all.

She never processed or retaliated that grief with innocents death. Like even Cersei after the death of Tommen didn't do anything as mad as Dany. Imagine that, Cersei was relatively (ya know cause she blew up the Sept of Baelor just prior to his death) more controlled than Dany after her loss. And as we all know from D&D Cersei was a very loving mother of course. (rolling eyes aggressively)\n\nCOME ON. SHE FLIPPED THE SWITCH LIKE THAT? WHAT? And those who say the signs were there, well suuuuuure. If you call what they did to her story for the past couple of seasons character development.\n\nI lived through the stupid bend the knee obsession and the memes. But good God. If you wanted to make her mad, you shouldn't have made her help the North. You should have made her consistently get paranoid and enraged. Instead I get this shit show.\n\nI can't even begin to rant about Tyrion, Jamie, and Varys so I'll just not.\n\nIt's just me trying to vent out. You may ignore and not bother pointing out how I'm wrong :/ I suppose the show lead her 'naturally' to this. But from my understanding of characters from the book, it seems absurd what's happening to them all. Maybe one day, god knows when, I'll know why each character did what they did.

How many people have had a long relationship end (or been divorced), gone and slept with someone else, and then felt the strong pull to go back. Some succumb, some don't. Jaime did. \n\n#2 With respect to Dany, she's always been willing to use violence to achieve her ends. Either she gets what she wants or she uses violence (not diplomacy) to get it. Granted, she often used violence with good intentions (slay the masters). The flip to burning women and children was rushed, but she did make it clear that since she couldn't rule via the people's love that she would rule by fear. Certainly accomplished that.\n\nSo not ideally what I'd envisioned, but not upset with it.",

He knew that once the realm knew about Jon's identity that Danaerys would never have a chance at the throne.\n\nThat's why he before he dies he says \"I hope I deserve this. I hope I'm wrong.\" He sincerely hopes that Dany isnt insane and is a just ruler and that he fucked up. In reality he was right and his move effectively gave Jon the throne whether he wanted it or not. He's a stupid Stark so he doesn't realize this. Nobody loves Dany and a man simply has precedence over a woman. \n\nDanaerys knows this, and the reason she loses it is because she knows that she no longer has a shot at the iron throne. Her entire existence is dedicated to sitting on that chair and now that she knows she can't have it she fucking snaps and burns it all.",

There's no supporters for her here. Yes she won the battle but there wasn't a lot of feasible support for her claim. So she said fuck it. But that second bit might be me reading too much into it.

Two episodes ago she was risking her life for complete strangers because she put the lives of her people before her political conquests. Now she just goes berserk on random civilians?\n\nSame thing with Jamie. I really thought he was going back to take down Cersei. His flip from good person back to Cersei\u2019s sycophant was way too sudden. A season (or even a few episodes) of him not fitting in with the North and being distracted with Brienne would have felt more earned. \n\nThe production was great as always, and there were some truly riveting moments, but overall I\u2019m super disappointed with how things are playing out",

That's still tragic, still her fault for being reckless and seeking revenge, but would be much more in line with how she does things.\n\nYou don't just snap and torch everyone like that with absolutely no dialogue leading to it or reasons to do so.  \n\nBut some people are lapping it up because \"women be crazy\".",

I don't care how pissed she was at everything that happened.

They literally just had her killing everyone for absolutely no reason. They have shown her as being power hungry and I see her stopping at nothing to get her goal but she got goal and then killed people.

I don't care how pissed she was at everything that happened. It would have made way more sense if the bell never rang and she had to make the decision to go through and fight her way to the Keep, obviously having some civilian casualties but still going forward with her goal to kill Cersei and take the throne. They literally just had her killing everyone for absolutely no reason. They have shown her as being power hungry and I see her stopping at nothing to get her goal but she got goal and then killed people. The writers obviously want no one to question whether or not Dany is mad or if she has some reedeeming qualities underneath it all, they've decided it for us and I feel that goes against the whole essence of the show.",

The whole \u201cevery time a Targaryen is born\u201d \nThis whole miserable awful season has been about characters unable to escape who they are: Tyrion and Jaime are conflicted and can\u2019t escape being Lannister\u2019s (does this make sense? Not really. Not for Jaimie) illustrated by tonight\u2019s episode. Sandro can\u2019t escape his inevitable showdown with the mountain. Hell even Gendry can\u2019t escape being Roberts bastard ie lords of storms end. And finally Theon couldn\u2019t escape being a stark and loving bran. If anything that\u2019s been the only theme this whole shit season has stayed consistent too: the players can\u2019t escape their fathers or themselves. And guess what? Danny is her father\u2019s daughter. And we\u2019re seeing that. And we saw it already. Boo hoo hoo it\u2019s not what you wanted. I guess your expectations got subverted didn\u2019t they?",

Well apparently they kept some behind because they were so cocksure of themselves being able to beat the dead that they wouldn't need all of their army.  \n\nWhat did they do with Jamie? What was that entire 'redemption' style arc about and sleeping with Brienne?

I am SO UPSET that he died consoling her, it felt cheap. It would've been so much better to have him sneak in, try to convince her to leave and have her refuse and try to kill him or whatever, so he would have to kill her and mourn her or whatever.",

I can\u2019t stand Dany and have always felt she was an impulsive, entitled conqueror who would let herself be so defined by what she saw as her right that it would ruin her and a lot of bystanders in the process. Her brand of horror is, to me, more kill a couple thousand civilians as collateral damage to crush an already defeated enemy than ignore her ultimate target in order to slaughter tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers who surrendered. \n\nI think there are things that make sense this season: her feeling of rejection by people she thought would welcome her home, feelings of isolation after loosing her closest confidants, etc. All of that culminating in her going out of her way to kill civilians? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me even if she was furious that after everything she lost they finally surrendered.\n\nI think your idea is more what I envisioned: her destroying just the Red Keep but the destruction being far more than she expected because of wildfire. She still would have been vilified but could have justified killing the people being used as a human shield by arguing that in killing them she saved millions more from someone like Cersei, and that she needed to send a decisive message to any who might think to defy her.\n\nIn another comment I mentioned her crucification of the masters in revenge for the crucified children that ended with her killing one of the masters that argued against doing it. The actions in this episode would be akin to her finding out the masters that crucified the children killed themselves when they realized they\u2019d lost, but she decided to crucify a random mix of people that included slaves and children anyway, because how dare the people of Mereen put her through that. The first is justifiable but still the result of a rushed decision, the latter is completely inexcusable and nonsensical.",

Now out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule them with a rod of iron.

They went shitty TV and had Sandor wound him a dozen times like he wasn't aware the undead could survive those type of injuries. Almost as if he hasn't spent two seasons fighting the undead in the North. Then Gregor disarms him but decided to throw him around for 10 minutes instead of killing him.

But I want to see how he practically forfeits all the progression his character has made for Cersei in the end. I want to know how, cause the show made it feel like he flipped a switch on a whim. It's not that I see Tyrion having no moral compass or that he will not become incompetent-ish one day, but I want to know how he gets to the point where he is practically the worst adviser ever and has somehow gotten a weak spot for Cersei and her child. He hates her, so what made him become this? The show didn't answer any of it for me. It seemed like we were watching one character in once instance, then a completely different one the next.

The people she is buring, to her, are the same people that killed her family and forced her to go to Essos.  It felt like a fitting move for the character of Dany to destroy KL, when finally faced with the opportunity to enact vengeance of the place and people which saw generations of her families rule come to an end.\nPersonally, I thought it was the best writing of the season.  They put a lot of clues into Dany going to KL to destroy it.  It made sense to destroy the GC because we have already had a few big battle episodes in recent memory (Battle of the Bastards, Loot Train, Long Night) and making this episode about a total ruthless massacre by an enraged Targeryn was a lot stronger writing than just a bunch of endless action scenes about trying to take KL back.\nFor me, this episode work on all levels.",

Her descent has been happening for literally over two seasons. She\u2019s been shown to be increasingly more ruthless since the end of season 6 when she executes the 3 masters, and the descent has decent justification. She\u2019s lost almost every one of her friends she had from Essos, 2 dragons which she considers her children, and the support of loving subjects and all of this happens across BOTH season 7 and 8. She\u2019s felt rejected by the westerosi since last season and that only gets amplified when Jon, the one with the better claim, is praised by them. \n\nDo you know how many episodes it takes for Dany to go from a submissive girl who obeys Viserys\u2019 every whim, to a confident wife who overcomes the strongest Dothraki warlord in Essos? About 2. You know how many until she happily watches her brother die, whom she was basically a servant to a couple episodes before? 6. \n\nLike I said, I agree that the regression of Dany\u2019s arc was taken too far with her murdering civilians after surrender, but the hinting at the reversal in her arc was so blatantly obvious since the end of last season. You calling it \u201cslight foreshadowing\u201d makes it sound like you just want it spelled out to you. Of course it got exponentially more obvious that she was getting more and more paranoid as we got closer to the pinnacle of it, but anyone who was paying attention knows it started a long time ago.",

As I said in my comment, I\u2019m not trying to criticize the book, I\u2019m drawing a comparison. If you think Dany\u2019s character development this season is rushed, how on earth is Dany\u2019s character development in season 1 (which happened in about 2-3 episodes with no episodes prior to even *argue* that it was slow) not rushed. \n\n**I** don\u2019t think either were particularly rushed, and I think a lot of people on this sub are being hypocrites about it.",

The mad queen theory was a thing last season, I can go back and find posts about it if you\u2019d like.\n\n>She is supposed to be the champion of the weak??\n\nSo you want her to be a static character from season 3 onward? Never changing, never developing because of hardship and loss? Do you think people never change their character based on the things happening around them? Even sometimes change for the worse because shitty things happen to them and no one is there to help them up? Her character developed upward from season 1 to 3 and in season 6 she started to descend. That\u2019s not an uncommon thing in writing and it\u2019s definitely not an unrealistic thing in real life. People can change completely because of a change in their environment and the loss of crucial support systems, are you kidding me?",

She\u2019s had an obvious character descent since season 6 and the only failure about it is that they decided to have her burn the city with no real justification, rather than her doing it out of apathy for the Westerosi and her goals to kill Cersei.\n\nI say this because most of the people on this sub have been complaining about her descent being rushed since last week, *before* any of them knew how it would go down this episode, when as far as we could tell from last episode, everything that Dany had done and was planning to do was justified based on her actions and her character regression in the past seasons. \n\nThe problem with Dany\u2019s arc isn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t do enough in the past seasons, they\u2019ve done more than enough to have Dany have a reasonable character regression that involves her burning the city.",

But they screwed up the approach so badly that it just feels flat, at best, and it leaves me feeling frustrated that we got everything we asked for, just in a way that we can't enjoy it.\n\nSpeaking of 'everything we asked for' ... that's another major problem. Martin's writing doesn't work that way. In the big finale we should surely get some of these things, but not all. Add in the ruined character arcs and the big moments we waited years for felt so hollow.\n\nA serious nod one scene in particular though. The writing was trash but the actors turned it into the best moment of the episode, and a much needed one after the terrible and empty version of this scene several seasons ago, the one the one they screwed up so bad despite having a damn book.",

Well, it's been a while since I've rewatched the show too, but there's very little of that early on, and as the show keeps going, they completely shit on him. To me, at least, he came off as power-hungry and uncaring. \n\nOne of the sample chapters released for TWoW takes place sometime before the battle against the Boltons, and he sends one of his knights to get more sellswords from Essos, telling him that if the battle doesn't go in his favor, the surviving knights pledged to him, along with the sellswords, are to fight to put Shireen on the Iron Throne. In the show, meanwhile, he burns Shireen as a sacrifice to R'hllor ahead of the battle. That goes against Book Stannis in at least two ways: Shireen is pretty much the only person he cares about, and he never believes in Melisandre's prophesies or the Lord of Light. He's just using her because his men converted to her religion and because she obviously has some kind of power. But he's in no way a true believer, let alone a fanatic who would burn his only daughter and his house's only heir because the Red Woman asked him to do it.",

Her killing the NK is fine, but if they deny Jon the death of Dany, I don't know why the Lord of Light brought Jon back. To be king? Really?",

So no, I'm not really satisfied with what they did.\n\nAnd this speaks to the larger point I was making - the show has decreased in quality continuously since they began diverging from the books. At first it was fine and they mimicked the complexity and characterization of the books well, but it started quickly getting more and more reductive.\n\nI don't even think Dany's reduction to a plot device is the worst in the show. In the past couple episodes, we've seen:\n\n1. Varys plot treason in broad daylight with a person who is devoted to the queen he's plotting against (completely reasonable behavior for a subtle, intelligent spymaster that has been playing this game his entire life)\n2. Jaime completely abandon the entirety of his character development to go save Cersei, just because... I dunno, honestly. There was no real justification for this, he basically outright said \"you know all the things I've done in the past 2 seasons? None of it was important at all\"\n3. Arya turned from a gradually mystifying angel of death into a deus ex machina plot device + girl that runs away from danger (I can respect if her plot arc means she genuinely gets re-humanized/re-discovers empathy, but it happens in the blink of an eye in the show)\n4. Bran sit around and do literally nothing of import... even his warging during the Battle of Winterfell served literally no purpose\n5. Etc.\n\nAnd then there's the biggest offense of all - the entirety of Euron's character. In the books, he's a terrifying sorcerer-pirate with motives that aren't entirely clear, except for the knowledge that whatever he wants goes well beyond mortal power/the Iron Throne. In the show, he's an idiotic pirate fuckboy with a penchant for doing whatever is needed to forward an increasingly predictable plot.\n\n>Contrast this with the slide of Stannis as he descended into his madness/thirst for power. The show no longer follows the thematic direction set earlier.\n\nI agree, and I think that's largely because Stannis' descent was gradual and involved lots of politics, other characters, and conflicting motives.

This is is a battle involving a gigantic dragon.

It was explicitly making fun of your idea. Sandor and Arya were on the assasination mission you wanted before both of them, and really the audience as well, realize that neither of them continue to have a real motive to kill a woman who is already doomed once the city starts to burn. Sandor is still pulled in by fate, but he continues to be self aware enough to serve as a tragic warning of what Arya could become. Sandor has every oppertunity to kill Cercei and Gregor makes the explicit step of ignoring her despite being her Kingsguard. They are both acknowledging GRRM's theory of how power lies in perception rather than empty titles, as well as demonstrating the selfishness of personal feuds. You even got the Mountain casually killing his Dr. Frankenstein for extra drama. \n\n\n>trial by combat\n\n\nYou want them to interrupt the sacking of a city for yet another trial by combat battle? Why would Danerys even care about this westerosi custom? If she did, her champion would just be Dacarys. \n\n\n>ehh we are both dead lets fight for no reason\n\n\n\n\nThey were fighting due to deep grudges steming from Gregor's childhood abuse of Sandor, questions of who was stronger, and Sandor realizing that his brother was a true monster even before becoming undead. \n\n\n>they fight like the 30 years before that?\n\nThey did. It was how Sandor acquired his burns. Him facing fire and death in the battle of Winterfell is what gave him the courage to seek a rematch despite such a decisive earlier defeat. The showrunners actually did a good job with the Hound's character. It just wasn't spelled out with narration from other characters so you missed it. The show lowered the standards of understanding characters so much that actually intelegent plots are just missed by viewers. \n\nThe battle wasn't perfect. It tried too hard to call back to the fight with Oberlyn, continued on the D&D trend of ignoring plates of armor for no reason, and simply  took too long, but setting wise it was very good.",

She was sold into slavery buy her brother in order to buy an army, pushed headfirst into a foreign culture that scares her and often threatens her, and quickly finds her feet as a ruler with the support of a husband she has come to love. This is in stark (hehe) contrast to Jon, who finds the wall not at all what he imagined, discovers he is no longer someone of any importance but just another soldier, and is forced to prove himself and his loyalty. Her having to rise up and meet this adversity is a big part of why the early seasons' development didn't feel rushed or forced.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the character traits Dany develops early is that she seeks to protect the innocent and punish those wrong. It's why she allows Viserys to die, protects the old lady and the women when the Dothraki sack the town, and then burn her when she brings about Drogo's catatonic condition. An entire series has been built on her seeking to protect the innocent and punish the wrongdoer in increasingly murky waters, where the line between right and wrong is a field of gray. **This was not one of those situations.** She heard the bells of surrender and decided to burn fleeing cityfolk. Talk all you want about foreshadowing, the foreshadowing was stupid and the action is still out of character. **She had already won, and there was nothing gray about the situation.**",

Japan had been planning on using the Soviets as an intermediary in peace talks but the Soviets were already planning on breaking the non aggression pact ( which surprised the Japanese ) so that plan was out the window anyways. The thought the Japanese would have accepted a realistic conditional surrendered is just a theory and is not proven at all. Hell some theorize the Japanese weren't even ready to surrender after the atomic bomb and the Soviets breaking their non aggression pact was what ended it as they were petrified of a communist government. \n\nYou don't stop fighting a war and leave your enemy time to regroup because they were considering having a half ally half enemy talk to you about maybe starting peace talks. There's no proof the U.S even knew that. Surrender really isn't the Japanese style anyways, so any peace talks would have been long and hard and a cease fire during those times would havr given the Japanese a pretty big advantage. They were pretty close to having jets, they could have been starting the process of buying time to give themselves time to roll those out and give themselves a massive air advantage.",

Literally struts, doesn\u2019t even run, even though time is obviously of the essence. \n* Jaime returns to King\u2019s Landing simply to die with Cersei, completely nullifying his redemption arc.

Not only was it needlessly interrupted with Supercuts to Arya getting stepped on, but it was just a boring fight. Oberyn v Mountain, Jaime v Ned, all much better battles with so much more at stake (not to mention you cared about the characters, then). Half the fight is spent watching Gregor bitchslap Hound until Hound stabs him in the face instead of the shoulder. Then he plummets them both into a pit of raging fire which doesn\u2019t matter because they were both going to die anyway. \n\nThat combined with the fact that all the characters and dialogue are so boring at this point that I could barely be bothered to care about any of them.

She just showed to all of the families of the Westeros (which will turn on her in the next episode 100%) that what Cersei kept saying was true, she is a foreign invader and an inheritor of the Targaryen madness.\n\n\\>What? Are you gonna write her character instead lol? This is some weird sort of projection mess\n\nMy whole point was that Daenerys as a queen has no right to act as a child and burn the people who she WANTS TO RULE OVER.\n\n\\>One where Danerys is satisfied\n\nIf her satisfaction comes from bringing harm to innocents, killing women and children and unarmed soldiers, then that is a sick fetish that people won't stand by. Did you forget that a rebellion happened when a king went berzerek? I'm confused... And I didn't listen to Tyrion much but HE WAS RIGHT, Daenerys became queen of the ashes and soon she will turn to ash.\n\nCersei didn't kneel and she killed Dany's best friend - Innocents going by their day will die an agonising death. Yep... seems about right. Dany didn't even kill Cersei, she didn't watch her die or something like that, NOPE Drogon burned a bit of the Red Keep and left it. Whether she died or left was irrelevant to her. Cersei could have fled the city before the siege and Dany wouldn't have knows.\n\nAnd no she was, again, NOT going for soldiers because soldiers were fighting the Unsullied and the North men so she would have burned them as well. And for soldiers dying by fire on the streets, it was one soldier for 15 civilians so don't give me that bullshit.",

In about every single one (including the one you\u2019re responding to) I restated and clarified that I am not defending the murder of the civilians after the surrender. I am denying the idea that her arc was rushed at all *before* that moment. \n\nUp until this episode there was nothing that Dany had done or was clearly planning to do that were unjustified based on past seasons. Despite that, the majority opinion of people here last episode was that the arc was rushed (despite not even knowing how far D&D take it this week). Last episode all she had said was that she was willing to take some civilian casualties if it meant securing the throne. So it\u2019s clear, to me at least, that most of the people saying \u201cthe arc was rushed\u201d this week are not solely saying that because of the events of this week, but because they feel that any descent at all is unjustified, and that idea is completely false.\n\nWhich is why I say in my comment that the problem with Dany\u2019s arc in the show is **only** how they executed it in this weeks episode, and not what most people have been saying since last week: that \u201cher descent was too rushed\u201d. Her descent wasn\u2019t rushed, she could have burned the city for a multitude of reasons that could be considered mad and the show would have plenty of justification to back that up. But the reason they chose was more sadistic than paranoid which is why the final action was badly done. But I don\u2019t think Dany\u2019s entire arc in the show should be blamed for that.",

As polite as you\u2019ve been, it\u2019s kind of annoying that I have to say this again, but **I DO NOT BELIEVE HER KILLING CIVILIANS AFTER WINNING THE BATTLE WAS THE RIGHT WAY TO EXECUTE THE DESCENT.**\n\nThe entire premise of my argument is that the fact that the writers decided to wait until *after* she had already won the battle to make her go on a rampage is the only problem with their execution of Dany this season, up to and including last episode. \n\nThe entire premise of my argument is that people have been arguing since last week that Dany\u2019s descent is rushed before they knew about the events of this episode, where it was only implied that she was willing to kill civilians in order to defeat Cersei.\n\nIt is not me defending her having a ptsd attack because some bells rang, it\u2019s me saying people are making bad arguments for why this episode is bad.\n\nThere is more than just foreshadowing that went into a reasonable descent in the past 2 seasons that could justify her not being as much of a champion of the innocent. Just because she was that way in the past does not mean she cannot change, and it would be more unrealistic if that was the case because people are constantly changing based on the situation around them.\n\nI notice you are able to acknowledge that Dany\u2019s character is able to change so quickly in the first season because of the adversity she had to go through and the situation she was in. Do you notice anything similar with how her character is changing this season? Do you deny how much adversity she\u2019s gone through since season 7 including loss and failure? Do you deny that the situation she\u2019s in, being somewhat foreign in a place that doesn\u2019t love her, could contribute further to that adversity? Don\u2019t you see how that\u2019s precisely the point of my comparison? \n\nI think people on this subreddit are way too attached to the idea that once a character develops they cannot regress in a satisfactory way. You bring up how shes tried to protect the innocent in the past, but that doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t change based on how her story has developed.",

Is that any less justified than her finally standing up to her brother who had borderline tortured her for years and was threatening her in an environment where she felt powerful?\n\nI\u2019m only attacking the character development in season 1 to show you how ridiculous it is to be saying the character development this season is \u201crushed\u201d. If you read my comment you would have seen that I said I\u2019m not trying to criticize the show just point out the hypocrisy of people who call this rushed simply based on episode count and don\u2019t consider any of the outside factors which have been built up for multiple seasons.",

It's mandatory promotional material that is forced to fit into very short time frames, shot in the middle of filming. Taking the author's word as the final say on their art isn't wrong, but it's always something you should problematize. You interrogate the product, not their cliffnotes.\n\n2/3. The show spent seasons showing how scorpions could kill dragons. I know people don't like it, but you can't just continue to insist it doesn't make sense. It's been telegraphed forever. This is very \"why didn't the eagles fly the rings to Mordor-y\". George even uses the Euron-esque plot device with Bittersteel. Blood Raven merks him with an anonymous arrow nobody ever sees. Ends the Blackfyre rebellion in a split second. It fits with Martin's themes. War is ugly, messy, and sometimes even awkward. Like the sputtering and flailing in Battle of the Bastards.\n\n3. Jaime's arc isn't thrown out the window. He goes back to try and save his sister. The last moments they spend together aren't romantic, or sexual, but familial. They are a rare glimpse at what the Lannisters could have been if they weren't all traumatized. Like the brief instant where even Jofferey is humanized as he dies. A glimpse at a could-have-been. He didn't stay in the North because he had unfinished business. He couldn't let his sister burn when he didn't have to pay for his crimes, which are in many ways just as bad as hers. The show gives you a chance to empathize with some of its biggest monsters (at least the ones who, unlike Ramsey and Gregor, become monsters because people choose to victimize them). That's empathy! It's asking you to think beyond just cheering when the character's you hate kick the bucket.",

It's just how it is. If this helps, because I was initially negative on the Long Night as well. Try and think of the show and books as not in competition. They have two different strengths. The shows can grab you, and force you to feel something more viscerally than the books can. They are more effective at showing the consequences of people's actions because they're not tied into the POV's. The books, when they come out, give you more interiority and clarity. When I stopped trying to think of what should have happened, or what would make the most logical, in universe sense, and began to pick apart the visuals and the themes, something clicked and my negativity flipped. I don't know whether that will help, or even if it's a problem that needs fixing, but it's just my two cents. I hated EP 3, and then I didn't, and now this is my single favorite episode of the entire show. Don't think you'll get the same out of it, but I'd rather you get something instead of nothing.",

While the show suffers heavily from telling rather than showing, this is an example where it works well.\n\n\n>wanted it to have more of a purpose\n\nNihlism is baked in by intention and is where the storytelling shines. Killing the Mountain was the Hound's mission since season 4. He fulfilled what is essentially his life purpose. There has not been a single 1v1 fight outcome in the series treated as a positive outcome since Jamie's fight with Brienne. The show has been treating violence as purposeless for a long time. \n\n\n>greater significance\n\nThe battle itself had no significance. Danerys is just as unhinged of a queen as Cercei. It is the characters finally acknowliging that nothing will ever get better that matters. Jamie and Euron come to a similar realization in their earlier duel, serving as parallel to hammer the point home. Sandor was never going to end the brutal contradiction inherent in Westerosi knighthood, expecially not through violence. The show is bonking us on the head with this theme of fights just resulting in 2 losers. \n\nIf you want significance to the final episode, the second in line to the Kingdom of the North has finally ended her edgy super-assasin revenge phase as it would be futile in achieving lasting satisfaction. She has learned from Sandor's character a lesson that the majority of the surviving cast still do not understand.

They went through pains to show us how much she hated it.\n\nShe didn't do more about the dragons because what could she do? She needed them to achieve her ultimate goal and they are her only children, which is questionable, but understandable.\n\nShe killed the Tarlys. This was questionable, but she felt she needed to show Westeros what happens when you oppose her if she wants to rule.

Like, that's not just a joke. If anything, my problem with this episode and the rest of the season is everyone BUT Dany.  They've added hints it could happen just like they added hints that Jon would fight the Night King, or that Arya would kill Cersei.

People saying she has been built up to be the Mad Queen over multiple seasons sound like the same people that said they heavily foreshadowed Arya killing the NK because of the \"shutting many eyes\" line that was said in a different order.

I prefer the book character, but this is who the character is in the show. \n\nThe other criticism of this episode--that the ballistas were suddenly feckless after easily killing a dragon last week--is valid, but I see that as an issue with the PREVIOUS episode. Those things should not have been stronger than a dragon. The last episode was stupid, but this one went back to the understanding of dragons that we know. Remember how last week everyone was complaining that Cersei and Euron were over powered just to make them a worthy final villain? Well, clearly that has been solved in this episode.\n\nThe third criticism is that Danny's turn heel makes no sense. But to me it does. They didn't properly prepare us for it in previous episodes, but the fact is that Dany has lost everyone she cared about--Drogo, Jorah, Missandei, Jon (as a lover), Rhaegon, Viserion--and everything that was her purpose: her claim to the throne, her chances of being loved as a ruler, her armies. It makes some sense that she could snap and I do think this will happen in the books, with better set up",

Do I have to go back to my point about how many episodes it took for Dany to gain enough confidence to overcome a Dothraki warlord despite being a weak and timid girl who was submissive to her brother who probably weighed no more than 150 pounds? Do I have to go back to that thing you said about ignoring all of the things happening in the background things that justify her arc?",

We know Lord Royce (a powerful lord in the Vale with likely a sizeable army) used his forces to capture Arryn in the Eyrie, Lord Greyjoy sent his fleet to deal with the one on the Iron Islands (if that\u2019s the Iron Fleet then that\u2019s a strong force), the Hand of the King was sent to deal with Red Harren so I doubt he had a small force with him and 3 lords and Orys Baratheon took on the Vulture King likely with a good force since he was said to have over 30,000 followers. \n\nMaybe they\u2019re not pretty big rebellions depending on how you want to measure the size of rebellions but they were big enough to be recorded and show that Aenys did not have a lot of love when he started his reign and was seen as a weak king. \n\nNot to mention the fact that 4 years into his reign the Faith started a large rebellion",

She wasn't rescuing them from a tyrant, she just showed up to help with the war against the dead...and then ultimately it was a Northerner, not Dany, who saved everyone. Dany failed. KL is completely different, it's in the grip of a tyrant which they both hate and fear, and it immediately surrendered without any real fight when she came for it. There's no reason to immediately conclude they would hate her. If at least they'd done something to INSPIRE that reaction, like maybe she starts to walk into the city and the people throw manure or rotten vegetables at her, and the kids spit at her or something, sure. Use the population's very vocal opinions about people to illustrate that she decides 'they'll just hate me? Fine, I'm going to rule by fear', not Jon refusing her booty call when he's *a northerner*.",

Comparing season 1 and 8.\n\nEdit: I have to say it's actually hilarious you brought up Barristan when we have no indication Dany even remembers him. Perfect example of the fan base filling in the blanks for them. Reminds me of when the guy did the math to prove the \"raven to dany\" followed by the dragon rescue was mathematically possible but the director up and said it all happened over the course of 1 day, completely shitting on all that guy's effort.",
